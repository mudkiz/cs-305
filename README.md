    Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
    My client wanted me to make sure that their data is protected. Then dealing with a clients money it is of the utmost importance to make sure that there is no way for someone to get in and take money from the company or the client or we will be in hot water. 
    I used ciphers certicicates and API dependancies that are up to date to achieve this.
    What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
    I used penetration testing to identify the vulnerabilities in the code which allowed me to make the best decision i could based on that and employ the security that i did.
    What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
    The entire thing was challenging to me as i was trying to remember what i had done previously so i had to look back at my old code to see what I should do and the old certificate assignment as i didnt remember how to do that either very well.
    Though once i figured out how to suppress the vulnerabilities it kinda clicked for me
    How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
    To increase the layers of security i used the SHA-256 algorithm to ensure that the information would be encoded and impossible to crack by any means. i would say the addition of 2 fascto authentication would be essential as well as it is one of the best ways to boost security
    How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
    After i refactored the code i ran it again to see if any new vulnerabilities showed up and used the console to check for them. If any showed up I would add them to the vulnerabilities.pom file
    What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
    I employed the use of google, stack overflow, and youtube videos all of which are incredibly handy in figuring out how to perform tasks iin the world of coding. I couldnt really getm uch out of the reading so I ended up having to scour google for better information.
    Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
    I would absolutely show them this project i learned a lot about how to test code for vulnerabilities and figure out how to self sign a certificate while making sure my code is secure with a hashing algorithm.
